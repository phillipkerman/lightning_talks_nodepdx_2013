Instructions
============
0. Come up with a title and description for your lightning talk (no more than 7 minutes please). Also think about whether one time slot is better than the other--choices: 
Thursday, May 16, 2:30-2:50
Friday, May 17, 1:10-1:50
1. Propose your talk by emailing me: phillipkerman@gmail.com
Or by cloning this repository, adding a document with your presentation title and preferred time slot, then make a pull request.
2. See your talk approved and/or scheduled below.
3. Be in contact with me to send your presentation at least 24 hours before your talk.  I'd like a .pdf or series of .png or .jpg files.  They won't be timed--you can either tap to advance nod to me and I'll jump to the next slide.
4. Suggest any variations.
